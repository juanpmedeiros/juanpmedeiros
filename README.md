# Hey, I'm Juan Medeiros 👋

I'm a **Senior Product Designer** over 10 years of experience — and 
a background that most designers don't have: I've actually written 
the code.

I started building CMS platforms and evolved into designing complex 
Management Systems used by thousands of people across Brazil. 
Along the way, I picked up C#, .NET, and Azure — not to become a 
developer, but to **speak the same language as the engineers** I 
work with.

Today, I use **AI as a frontend tool** — combining Figma design 
systems with React, TypeScript and Claude/Cursor to ship interfaces 
that are not just beautiful, but production-ready.

## What makes me different

- 🎨 **Design Systems at scale** — built to grow with the product
- 🧠 **Developer fluency** — I debug, read code and think in logic  
- 🤝 **Engineering collaboration** — I solve problems before they hit the code  
- ⚡ **AI-powered delivery** — from wireframe to deployed frontend, faster
